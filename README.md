#Functional Programming  
Some guy was just presenting about his "functional programming".  
It was "greek to you" (or maybe "Bar-bar-bar-barian" - lol).  

The boss seemed impressed, but you didn't get it at all.  
(Are you the only one?  Nobody else said nothing!)  

Not to worry, sometimes people get something working but they don't really understand it, or they understand something but can't put it into words.  

Don't be dis-functional, just dip a cup or two from this well.  
:-)
